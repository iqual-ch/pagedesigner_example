# Example Module for Pagedesigner

This module serves as an example for the integration with the Pagedesigner module.
The extensibility of the Pagedesigner module is shown through creating handler plugins for the image and html types.

In the Text Handler implementation, a random text is appended to the html element.

In the Image Handler implementation, a default image is shown when editing the element.
